# Wordle Analysis Functions

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/MarkNOakden/Wordle/HEAD?labpath=wordle_elimination_graph.ipynb)

The main motivation for this is to share the code I use to produce my "Word
Elimination Progress" plots since people on twitter were asking where I was 
getting them from.

# Important Note re: Spoilers

The Jupyter notebook in this repository contains a spoiler for Wordle number

243. If you are somehow doing historical Wordles and don't want to see a spoiler
     for this, don't look at the notebook!

Equally, the code requires a copy of the Wordle JavaScript source (not included
here!). This contains the entire list of ~2300 Wordle words, in order. Don't
examine that source too closely if you don't want spoilers.
